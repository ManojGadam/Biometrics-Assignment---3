# Biometrics-Assignment---3

Take 5 pictures of your hand. Decide on the experimental setting, position of the hand, the surface, the distance from the camera, such that the measurements do not vary due to such external conditions. 

-- Calculate the distance-based hand feature vector described in the class slides, setting the axes manually: Do not set the distances (points on the hand borders) manually; rather, define the lines along the finger lengths. For each line you will need to set manually two points. The desired axes (along the finger widths), along which the intensity profiles will be recorded, should be perpendicular to those lines at the set points. For those axes where you cannot set two such points (e.g., palm), you can set at most any two points (except for points on the hand outline). Do not set manually any point on the hand boundary for any reason. 

-- For each instance/image of your hand, calculate the feature vector.

-- Compare the 5 feature vectors (pairwise comparisons between the hand images).
